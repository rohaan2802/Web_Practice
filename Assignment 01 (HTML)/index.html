	<h2><ins> Introduction To React</h2> </ins>
	<p> React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and<b> you can use as<br>
        little or as much React as you need.</b> Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to<br>
        a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help<br>
        you get started. </p> <br>
	<h2><ins> Step-by-Step Guide </ins> </h2>
	<p> If you prefer to<b> learn concepts step by step</b>, our guide to main concepts is the best place to<br>
	start. Every next chapter in it builds on the<mark> knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so<br>
	you won’t miss anything as you go along.</mark> Once you’re comfortable with the main concepts and played<br>
	with React a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce<br>
	you to the powerful, but less commonly used React features like context and refs. </p>
